# Blobly Net — Roadmap

The host-side automotive bus tester (CAN + Ethernet protocols), written in V. This file is the
forward-looking "what's coming"; shipped detail lives in git and [`docs/`](docs/), and the
archived development log is [`docs/history.md`](docs/history.md).

Status keys: ✅ shipped · 🔨 in progress · ⏭️ next · 🧭 planned · ⛔ out of scope

## Shipped

**Buses & transport**
- ✅ **SocketCAN** (Linux) — `vcan0` virtual and real adapters · ✅ **PCAN** (Windows)
- ✅ UDP software bus (`inproc:`) — driver-free tests and demos

**CAN & databases**
- ✅ Live trace, send panel, signal decode
- ✅ **DBC** parse/decode/encode (`candb`), incl. multiplexing and value tables
- ✅ **DBC editor** — forms, bit-matrix grid, live-loop save, read-only while running, and a
  **canonical writer** so a save/load cycle never drifts a file (git diffs show real changes only)

**Diagnostics**
- ✅ **ISO-TP** (ISO 15765-2) · ✅ **UDS client** · ✅ **DoIP** (ISO 13400 — UDS over TCP)
- ✅ **Flashing** — `cmd/flash` + the GUI Flash panel; UDS firmware download against a
  blobly_emb bootloader, with **0x29 challenge/response** auth (retired 0x27 seed/key)

**Ethernet services**
- ✅ **SOME/IP** — 16-byte header codec, envelope validation, golden vectors, and an **RPC client**
  (with the eth shell in the GUI) cross-checked against blobly_emb by an oracle

**Simulation, logs & replay**
- ✅ Simulated ECUs (`sim`) — tests need no hardware
- ✅ `candump -l` logs · ✅ native **ASAM MDF4** (`.mf4`) reader (no Python/asammdf)
- ✅ **Replay** at the recording's original cadence

**Observability**
- ✅ **Trace chart** — handler/thread swimlanes, derived idle lane, execution-vs-response bars,
  preemption cut-links, per-core lanes, RTOS priority labels, multi-block dump
- ✅ **System panel** (`sysview`) — read-only view of a blobly_emb `system.toml` + node
  `ecu.toml`s: communication matrix, node identities, per-bus id allocation with collisions
- ✅ **Shell panel** — interactive console to the target over CAN

**Platform**
- ✅ **Dear ImGui + ImPlot** GUI (migrated from vlang/gui, 2026-07-06) · ✅ Windows build + CI
- ✅ **Lua scripting** — test framework, headless runner for CI, Script panel in the GUI
- ✅ `.blobnet` project files

## Next

- ⏭️ **`fill_rect` / drawlist binding in `vgui`** — the blocker for two shipped-adjacent features:
  **trace-manifest rows** and a **drawn topology graph** in the System panel both wait on it.
- ⏭️ **System wizards** ([`docs/dbc_editor.md`](docs/dbc_editor.md)) — "add a signal/frame"
  generators that emit correctly-shaped TOML blocks to **append**. Deliberately *not* a TOML
  editor: mutations must never rewrite the file, so comments survive and diffs stay clean.
- ⏭️ **UDS server side** (`modules/uds` server, or `modules/diagserver`) — sessions, RDBI/WDBI
  DIDs, tester-present, security, routines. The native twin of `sut/uds_server.py`, config-driven
  per node ([`docs/simulation_architecture.md`](docs/simulation_architecture.md)).

## Planned

- 🧭 **SOME/IP-SD** (service discovery) + the SOME/IP **sim service** — explicitly deferred in
  [`docs/ethernet_architecture.md`](docs/ethernet_architecture.md).
- 🧭 **DoIP per-connection handler state** — deferred pending the threading change.
- 🧭 **LIN** — `modules/lindb` (LDF) + a `LinFrame` type. Kept type-safe alongside `CanFrame` /
  `EthFrame` rather than faked behind a generic frame.

## Out of scope

- ⛔ **Automotive Ethernet PHYs** (100BASE-T1, 1000BASE-T1) and **TSN/AVB**. Ethernet here is
  ordinary TCP/UDP sockets; what is automotive is the protocols on top (DoIP, SOME/IP).

## Cross-repo: blobly_emb

blobly_net is the **tester**; [blobly_emb](docs/blobly_emb_synergies.md) is the **SUT** (the
embedded ECU stack). Wire formats — trace records, SOME/IP datagrams, telemetry, the flashing
protocol — are pinned by **golden vectors on both sides**, so they change together. When emb adds
a wire-visible feature, the matching host support usually lands here in the same period.
